**# Package-Based Subscription Plan**

## **Overview**
This document outlines a binary package-based subscription system with a two-level referral structure. The system rewards users for direct and indirect referrals while incorporating a passive income model.

## **Subscription Packages**
We offer two subscription plans:

| Plan Name  | Price  | Direct Referral Bonus | Indirect Bonus | Monthly Passive Bonus | Max Earnings Cap |
|------------|--------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Basic**  | $100   | $20 (20%)             | $10 (10%)      | $5 per user           | $1,000           |
| **Premium**| $500   | $100 (20%)            | $50 (10%)      | $20 per user          | $5,000           |

## **How It Works**
### **1. Referral Structure**
- **Level 1 (Direct Bonus):** Earn 20% of the package price for each personally referred user.
- **Level 2 (Indirect Bonus):** Earn 10% from second-level referrals (users referred by your direct referrals).

### **2. Passive Income Model**
- Monthly earnings accumulate based on active referrals.
- Users continue to earn even if they do not refer new users actively.

## **Earnings Calculation Example**

### **Scenario:** You choose the **Premium Package ($500)**
1. You refer **2 users (Premium Plan each)**
   - You earn **$100 x 2 = $200 (Direct Bonus)**
2. Your 2 users each refer **2 more users (Premium Plan each)**
   - You earn **$50 x 4 = $200 (Indirect Bonus)**
3. Monthly passive earnings continue based on active users in your network.

### **Total Earnings:**
- **$400 from referrals + ongoing monthly passive income**
